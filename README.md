# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, and asked to complete the test suites.

# How did I complete this project?

1. I wrote the first test suite to check that all the feeds' names and URLs are properly loaded.
2. I wrote the second test suite to check for the menu bar (ie. hidden by default, display at first click, and hides at the next click), by checking the behavior of the `menu-hidden` class.
3. I wrote the third test suite to check that the `loadfeed` function completes its work, by having at least one entry on the page. 
4. I wrote a fourth test sute to check that the feeds changes after every refresh.
